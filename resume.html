      <h3>Nice to Meet You</h3>
      <p>
        Thank you for visiting my résumé webpage! I know you're a busy
        professional with many demands on your time, so I'm genuinely glad you
        took took the time to take a look. I hope you like what you see.
        </p>
        <p>
        I made a short video to briefly introduce myself. I hope that after your
        visit you know me a little better and have a feel for both the skills I
        bring to the table and the kind of employee I would be. If you think I
         might be a good match for your company, please contact me. I'd be happy
         to discuss in greater detail how I could bring my skills to bear on the
         specific problems you hope to solve. Thank you again.
