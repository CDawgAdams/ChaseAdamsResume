# ChaseAdamsResume
My first attempt at a website. 

The document itself is intended to be a resume. 

I'm taking a class on HTML and CSS. I'm attempting to use as many of attributes/elements/properties as I can. I'm a total noob to HTML and CSS and this is the first HTML/CSS I'ver ever written. If the communtiy can help me polish it, I welcome input.
